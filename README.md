# Nike Landing Page

A clone of Nike's landing page.

# How it's made:

This website was made using JavaScript, TailwindCSS, Vite and NextJS. Utilized certain custom tailwind classes in order to achieve the best result possible.

# Optimizations
Current optimization would be making the hamburger menun function, should be done shortly.

# Lessons Learned:
I've learned that having CSS be more streamlined through the use of TailwindCSS, it allows me to create something more complex and better organized.
